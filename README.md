# Exploring-Text-Embedding-Techniques-for-Clustering-of-Research-Papers
This project explores text embedding techniques (One-Hot, BoW, N-Grams, TF-IDF) for clustering research papers using K-Means. PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization. Also includes supervised classification with Random Forest, evaluated using Accuracy and F1 Score.
